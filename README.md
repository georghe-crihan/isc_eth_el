# Compilable source for a NIC driver for ISC Interactive UNIX 3COM EtherLink 3C503 card

The driver (el) as included in a stock ISC UNIX distribution has been reverse-engineered.

The intent is to allow development of virtual NICs for various VMs (VMWare, Parallels, VirtualBOX, etc.) to allow the OS to run in a Virtualized environment.
